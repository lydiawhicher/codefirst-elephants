	A world without elephants is unimaginable. Yet because of human-inflicted threats, elephant populations have suffered devastating declines. The numbers are sobering: 1.3 million African elephants roamed the continent in 1979, but as few as 420,000 remain today. Asian elephant populations are also plummeting, with less than 30,000 remaining.

	One of the biggest threats to elephants is poaching for their ivory tusks. However, habitat loss and expanding human populations are also taking huge tolls. Humans and elephants are left to compete over the shrinking land, resulting in increasing incidents of dangerous – and sometimes even deadly – conflict.

	Like African elephants, Asian elephants are also suffering declines from habitat loss, conflict, and poaching. However, they are also facing a unique new threat: a demand for jewellery and traditional medicines made from their skin. Conservationists fear this gruesome practice may even replace ivory as a motive for poaching. Unlike African elephants, where both males and females have tusks, only male Asian elephants have tusks. This means that ivory poaching is less of a threat to Asian elephants, since females and young are not targeted. The trade in skin, however, does not discriminate. Gabriel Fava, Born Free’s Associate Director, Asia & Oceana, says, “… the skin trade means it’s now open season on entire herds, as we’ve seen from reports and images of groups of elephants of all ages found together, slain and skinned. The horror of this trade is second to none.”
